WorkflowScheduling-Claud
========================

NASA’s High-End Computing Capability (HECC) project is designed to accelerate and enhance scientific discovery and aeronautics research. The mission of this project is to develop a technique that bridges the gap between scientific workflow design tool and NASA’s Supercomputer Center, so that scientists can run their big data experiments at NASA’s Supercomputer Center and Amazon cloud without leaving their design environment. In this technical report, we describe our proposed architecture and the implementation of a working prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of our solution.
